# FeedReader Tester - Project 4

This project uses **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** to present a basic RSS Feed reader. The project also uses Jasmine to provide thorough testing of the application through a series of tests and expectations, ensuring event handling and DOM manipulation works as expected.

## Getting Started
